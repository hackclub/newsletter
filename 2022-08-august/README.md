<img src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM-U026XSMKEDC-a471d7e9c871-512" width="16"> [Maggie](https://maggieliu.dev) shipped [Replbio](https://replit.com/@MaggieLiu1/replbio?v=1), an easy way to make one of those fancy bio pages you've seen on the net: you just define your name, profile picture, and social links in JSON, and it gets hosted on Replit, complete with a guestbook üòÆ!! Check out Maggie's [own bio page here](https://replbio.maggieliu1.repl.co). I asked her how she got the idea for Replbio: _"Glitch has a cool glitch-in-bio project, so i thought it would be fun to make one that worked on Replit and add more features!"_

It let's you view multiple dinos at once instead of scrolling through the [hackclub/dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs) repo. Here's Jaden's motivation behind the [JavaScript project](https://github.com/InternetRamen/dino-explorer) was: _"I made dino explorer to see all the amaazing dinos at once :0"_

Why? Because _"facebook is slow so lets make react fast"_

_"I wanted a high level language with a strong type system that compiles (zig does exactly that) but i wanted to implement my own compiled language"_. Truly <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/based/537b2120c51f688d.png" width="16">

It just hit 500 users üéâ. You can find the code (mostly TypeScript) [on GitHub](https://github.com/jmurphy5613/guess-that-rank).

When asked why he made GuessThatRank, John had a really relatable answer:

### Milkshakes, Stupid Sh*t Nobody Needs & A Rogue Dinosaur.

Yes, I'm talking about Assemble. Or rather, <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39828164?v=4" width="16"> [Sam](https://sampoder.com) is:

How does one put fourty-two hours of chaos into a couple of sentences? I'm not sure, but I'm going to give it a shot. On August 5th, 175 Hack Clubbers descended on Market Street in San Francisco for the first high school hackathon in üåÅ San Francisco since the pandemic! Together, we built projects based on the prompt "Stupid Shit Nobody Needs", fought <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38882631/185447991-cf6a6e84-585e-4f71-9546-fdf315e816ce.png" width="16"> The Organization, chugged down (potentially) dangerous amounts of caffeine, had a late-night disco and much more.

The highlight for me, however, was getting the chance to meet so many Hack Clubbers! We had folks from 12 different countries and 20+ US states, each of them incredibly special individuals who I wish I could have spent hours more talking to. Words really can't describe the ‚ú® magical ‚ú® atmosphere that took over Figma's office that weekend.
